# C header files
Useful Header files for including in your C programs.

All header files are Copyright under the GNU General Public License 2007 of the Free Software Foundation, thus, making them completely 
free to use, distribute and/or modify. This was intended to make it *free to all* and used accordingly in your C programs to make coding 
easier and more clean.

##Including the header files in your C programs
To include a custom header file in your C program, download the **include** folder in this repository and copy its contents to your 
compiler's include folder. Where your compiler's include folder is will depend on what platform or software you're using to make 
your C programs (could be Dev C/C++, Turbo C, or linux, etc). After this, you will be able to include those files in your C programs 
just like any other header files like stdio.h, etc.
